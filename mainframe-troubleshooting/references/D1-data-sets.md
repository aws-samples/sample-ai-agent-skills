# D1 — Mainframe Modernization Data Set Issues

## Symptoms
- Data set not found errors
- Data set creation fails
- Data set content incorrect

## Triage Commands

```bash
aws m2 list-data-sets --application-id <app-id> --max-results 20
aws m2 get-data-set-details --application-id <app-id> --data-set-name <name>
```

## Data Set Types
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| VSAM KSDS | Key-sequenced data set |
| VSAM ESDS | Entry-sequenced data set |
| VSAM RRDS | Relative record data set |
| PS | Physical sequential |
| GDG | Generation data group |

## Common Causes
1. **Not imported** — Data set not yet imported from S3
2. **Name mismatch** — Data set name doesn't match JCL/program reference
3. **Format error** — Import file format doesn't match data set type
4. **Record length** — LRECL mismatch between definition and data
5. **Organization** — Wrong data set organization specified

## Resolution
- Import data set: `aws m2 create-data-set-import-task --application-id <id> --import-config <config>`
- Verify data set name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure import file format matches target data set type
- Check record length and block size match source definitions


## Safety Ratings

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Data Risk | Medium | Operations may affect service configurations and data access patterns |
| Service Impact | High | Incorrect changes can disrupt active workloads and dependent services |
| Recovery Complexity | Medium | Most actions are reversible but may require coordinated rollback procedures |
| Blast Radius | Medium | Impact typically scoped to the affected resource and its direct dependents |

## Escalation Conditions

- **Escalate immediately** if the issue involves potential data loss or corruption
- **Escalate immediately** if a production workload is impacted and cannot be restored within the agreed SLA
- **Escalate immediately** if the root cause is unclear after initial diagnostic steps are exhausted
- **Escalate to service team** if the issue appears to be a platform-level bug or undocumented behavior
- **Escalate to security team** if unauthorized access, policy violations, or credential exposure is suspected

## Data Sensitivity

- Verify data classification before performing any read or export operations
- Ensure all troubleshooting outputs (logs, configurations, snapshots) are handled according to the customer's data handling policy
- Mask or redact personally identifiable information (PII) in all shared diagnostics
- Do not copy production data to non-production environments without explicit authorization
- Retain troubleshooting artifacts only for the duration required and dispose of them securely

## Prohibited Actions

- **NEVER** terminate a running mainframe environment without confirming all batch jobs have completed
- **NEVER** modify CICS transaction definitions on a production runtime without a tested rollback plan
- **NEVER** delete or overwrite production data sets without verified backups
- **NEVER** alter JCL configurations for active batch processing workflows without scheduling a maintenance window
- **NEVER** force-stop a Blu Age or Micro Focus runtime with in-flight transactions

## Phase 3 � Rollback

1. **Identify rollback trigger**: Determine if the applied change has caused degradation, unexpected behavior, or failed validation checks
2. **Preserve current state**: Capture logs, configuration snapshots, and resource states before initiating rollback
3. **Execute rollback steps**: Revert configuration changes in reverse order of application, verifying each step
4. **Validate service recovery**: Confirm that the service has returned to its pre-change operational state using health checks and functional tests
5. **Document rollback**: Record the rollback trigger, steps taken, time to recovery, and any residual issues for post-incident review
## Safety Ratings

safety_ratings:
  - "Phase 1 triage commands (describe/get/list): GREEN — read-only"
  - "Phase 2 configuration changes: YELLOW — state-changing but recoverable"
  - "Phase 2 resource deletion or security changes: RED — destructive or irreversible"

## Escalation Conditions

escalation_conditions:
  - "Remediation requires modifying IAM policies in a production account"
  - "Remediation requires disabling a security control even temporarily"
  - "Root cause cannot be identified after 3 hypothesis pivots"
  - "Blast radius affects more than one account or region"
  - "Issue involves potential data loss or exposure"

## Data Sensitivity

data_sensitivity:
  - command: "describe-* commands"
    sensitivity: MEDIUM
    contains: "Service configuration and resource details"
  - command: "get-* commands"
    sensitivity: MEDIUM
    contains: "Service configuration and resource details"
  - command: "list-* commands"
    sensitivity: MEDIUM
    contains: "Service configuration and resource details"

## Prohibited Actions

prohibited_actions:
  - "NEVER suggest overly broad IAM permissions as a fix"
  - "NEVER suggest disabling security controls for troubleshooting"
  - "NEVER suggest deleting resources without confirmation"
