# Z1 — SMS General Troubleshooting

## When No Specific Runbook Matches

## General Diagnostic Commands

```bash
aws sms get-connectors --max-results 10
aws sms get-servers --max-results 50
aws sms get-replication-jobs --max-results 20
aws sms list-apps --max-results 20
aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventSource,AttributeValue=sms.amazonaws.com --max-results 20
```

## Escalation Checklist
1. Connector status and version
2. Server catalog contents
3. Replication job IDs and status
4. Recent replication run results
5. Application configuration (if using app migration)
6. IAM role configuration
7. CloudTrail events
8. Note: Recommend MGN for new migrations


## Safety Ratings

| Phase 2 Action | Rating | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Investigate and collect diagnostic data | GREEN | Read-only analysis; no state change |
| Modify configuration settings | YELLOW | Configuration change; reversible with backup |
| Restart or reboot components | YELLOW | Service interruption; recoverable |
| Delete or remove resources | RED | Potentially destructive; requires confirmation and backup |

## Escalation Conditions

- Production environment impact detected or imminent
- Multiple failed remediation attempts (>2 cycles without resolution)
- Security-related root cause identified (unauthorized access, data exposure)
- Issue requires cross-service or cross-account coordination
- Customer-facing service degradation exceeding SLA thresholds
- Regulatory or compliance implications discovered during investigation

## Data Sensitivity

- Server catalog reveals on-premises infrastructure details
- Replication data contains VM disk contents
- Migration configurations reveal network topology
- Classification: CONFIDENTIAL - infrastructure details and VM data

## Prohibited Actions

- NEVER delete replication jobs with in-progress migrations
- NEVER modify server catalog mappings during active replication
- NEVER terminate migration runs without confirming rollback capability
- NEVER remove SMS connectors while replication jobs are active

## Phase 3 -- Rollback

MUST:
- Document all changes made during Phase 2 remediation
- Verify rollback procedures exist before applying any fix
- Confirm service health after rollback using the same diagnostic steps from Phase 1
- Notify stakeholders if rollback is initiated in production

SHOULD:
- Maintain a timeline of all actions taken for post-incident review
- Capture before/after configuration snapshots
- Test rollback in non-production environment when possible
- Update runbook with lessons learned after incident resolution

MAY:
- Automate rollback procedures for frequently occurring issues
- Create CloudWatch alarms to detect regression after rollback

## Safety Ratings

safety_ratings:
  - "Phase 1 triage commands (describe/get/list): GREEN — read-only"
  - "Phase 2 configuration changes: YELLOW — state-changing but recoverable"
  - "Phase 2 resource deletion or security changes: RED — destructive or irreversible"

## Escalation Conditions

escalation_conditions:
  - "Remediation requires modifying IAM policies in a production account"
  - "Remediation requires disabling a security control even temporarily"
  - "Root cause cannot be identified after 3 hypothesis pivots"
  - "Blast radius affects more than one account or region"
  - "Issue involves potential data loss or exposure"

## Data Sensitivity

data_sensitivity:
  - command: "describe-* commands"
    sensitivity: MEDIUM
    contains: "Service configuration and resource details"
  - command: "get-* commands"
    sensitivity: MEDIUM
    contains: "Service configuration and resource details"
  - command: "list-* commands"
    sensitivity: MEDIUM
    contains: "Service configuration and resource details"

## Prohibited Actions

prohibited_actions:
  - "NEVER suggest overly broad IAM permissions as a fix"
  - "NEVER suggest disabling security controls for troubleshooting"
  - "NEVER suggest deleting resources without confirmation"
